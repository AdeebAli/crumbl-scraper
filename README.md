# Crumbl Scraper üç™

The TypeScript + NodeJS app that displays this week's cookie flavors at [Crumbl Cookie](https://crumblcookies.com/). The long term goal is to make this into a Serverless HTTP Get Request or a REST API.

## Requirements

* NodeJS 16+
* Yarn 3

## Getting Started

```bash
    yarn install # installs dependencies
```

```bash
    yarn build # transpiles and builds TypeScript code into /dist folder
```

```bash
    yarn start # starts the app from the /dist folder
```

To run the application with a live dev server that supports hot module refreshing, run

```bash
    yarn run dev
```

## Linting / Code Style

This project uses ESLint to enforce code style and fix syntax errors. Linting is run with the lint command.

To run the linter and check for code style errors, run 

```bash
    yarn run lint
```

Oh no! We have a bunch of linting errors. That's totally fixable! You just need to run

```bash
    yarn run lint:fix
```
